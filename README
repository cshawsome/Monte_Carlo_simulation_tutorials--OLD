This repository provides Stata code for quantifying bias in estimation of the effect of a binary exposure (A) on a binary outcome (Y) arising from conditioning on a collider (S), where S is a common effect of the exposure and an unmeasured determinant of the outcome (U). 
Input parameters can be modified by the user.  

Steps for running the simulation code
1) For each causal structure of interest, save two Stata do-files: a. the data generation and analysis file and b. the run simulation file.
-The data generation and analysis file generates one data set, analyzes the generated data, and stores the parameter estimates from analyses as scalars. 
-The run simulation file calls the data generation and analysis file B times to generate and analyze B data sets, stores the results from each iteration of data set generation, summarizes the results across the B data sets, and exports the results for each iteration of sample generation in a Statafile (one sample = one row in the file).

2) Update the parameter values in "Step 1: Set parameters" of the data generation and analysis file to reflect the desired input paramters for investigation. 
-For example, to modify the  simulation so there is a causal effect of A on Y, modify local parameter "b1" in the data generation and analysis file. 

3) Run B iterations of data generation and summarize results from statistical models estimating the effect of A on Y across the  B iterations of sample generation by running the run simulation Stata do-file.
   
The data-generating process is outlined graphically in the file Collider_bias_simulation_data_generation.pdf.
